# Distributed-trading-system-with-blockchain-consensus

Custom Consensus Protocol: Implement a novel consensus algorithm optimized for financial transactions, potentially based on epidemic protocols like BECP which outperforms traditional Paxos and PBFT by 1.196x in throughput

Real-time Order Book: Maintain distributed order books across multiple nodes with microsecond-level synchronization

Smart Contract Integration: Develop smart contracts for automated trade execution and settlement

Multi-chain Architecture: Support cross-chain trading capabilities



It enables **secure, low-latency, real-time order matching** across multiple market participants.

The system is designed to:
- Maintain distributed order books across a peer-to-peer network
- Achieve high throughput with a **custom consensus protocol**
- Perform **cross-chain trade settlement** using smart contracts

## Key Features
- **Custom Consensus Protocol** optimized for financial trading
- **Decentralized Order Matching** for fault tolerance
- **Cross-Chain Trading** support
- **Smart Contracts** for automated settlement
- **High Availability Architecture** with fault-tolerant design

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Go / Rust
- **Consensus Layer**: Custom Protocol (inspired by PBFT, Raft, EPID)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum + Solidity
- **Database**: LevelDB / RocksDB
- **Networking**: gRPC, WebSockets
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Architecture
1. **Peers** run order book replicas
2. Orders broadcast via gossip protocol
3. Consensus nodes confirm and settle trades
4. Settlement recorded on blockchain

1. Start all consensus nodes
2. Submit trades using REST API
3. Monitor trade finality on blockchain explorer
